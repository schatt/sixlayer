The framework is distributed as a Swift Package from the `Framework/` directory. This ensures that only the essential framework code is included when other projects consume it.

## 🆕 Latest Release: v7.5.1

### **platformFrame Min Clamping Fix**
🔧 **Bugfix**: Clamp minWidth/minHeight on iOS and watchOS/tvOS/visionOS to 90% of available space when they exceed screen size, preventing overflow. Matches macOS behavior. Fixes #182.

### **Previous Release: v7.5.0 - Minor Release**
📋 **Documentation & quality**: Release notes, AI agent guide, and version consistency updates. Resolved 20 issues from milestone v7.5.0. Fully backward compatible.

### **Previous Release: v7.4.2 - @MainActor Concurrency Fix for platformFrame**
🔧 **Concurrency Correctness**: Added `@MainActor` annotation to `platformFrame()` functions to ensure correct Swift concurrency behavior. Makes concurrency requirements explicit and allows functions to be called from non-isolated contexts with `await`. Aligns with Swift 6 strict concurrency requirements.

### **Previous Release: v7.4.1 - idealWidth and idealHeight Support for platformFrame**
🆕 **Complete Frame API**: Added `idealWidth` and `idealHeight` parameter support to `platformFrame()` to match SwiftUI's native `.frame()` modifier API. Ideal sizes are automatically clamped to screen/window bounds on all platforms. Implementation simplified for better maintainability.

### **Previous Release: v7.4.0 - PhotoPurpose Refactoring (⚠️ Breaking Change)**
⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE**: `PhotoPurpose` converted from enum to struct. Vehicle-specific cases (`vehiclePhoto`, `fuelReceipt`, etc.) removed and replaced with generic purposes (`.general`, `.document`, `.profile`, `.reference`, `.thumbnail`, `.preview`). Projects can maintain backward compatibility using extension aliases. See migration guide in release notes.

### **Previous Release: v7.3.0 - Convenience Aliases and Code Quality Improvements**
🆕 **Platform Container Stack Aliases**: Added shorter convenience aliases `platformVStack`, `platformHStack`, and `platformZStack` for more intuitive API names. Refactored iCloud availability checks for improved code clarity.

### **Previous Release: v7.2.0 - Configurable Photo Sources for OCR Scanner**
🆕 **FieldActionOCRScanner Enhancement**: Added configurable photo source options. Developers can now choose whether to offer camera, photo library, or both options to end users, with automatic device capability detection and graceful fallbacks.

### **Previous Release: v7.1.0 - Color Resolution System from Hints Files**
🆕 **ItemBadge and ItemIcon Components**: New components that automatically resolve colors from hints files. Supports colorName and fileExtension provider types. Card components now support optional badge content.

### **Previous Release: v7.0.2 - Hints File Presentation Properties Support**
🆕 **Presentation Properties in Hints Files**: Added support for `_dataType`, `_complexity`, `_context`, `_customPreferences`, and `_presentationPreference` in `.hints` files. All PresentationHints properties can now be configured declaratively in hints files, matching code-based functionality.

### **Previous Release: v7.0.1 - Hints File Color Configuration Support**
🆕 **Color Configuration in Hints Files**: Added support for `_defaultColor` and `_colorMapping` in `.hints` files. Color configuration can now be stored in hints files and automatically loaded when creating `PresentationHints` from model names.

### **Previous Release: v7.0.0 - Breaking Changes**
⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE**: `CardDisplayable` protocol no longer includes `cardColor` property. Color configuration is now done via `PresentationHints` at the presentation layer. Models are now SwiftUI-free and can be used in Intent extensions.

🆕 **PresentationHints Color Configuration**: Added type-based color mapping, per-item color provider, and default color support. Color decisions are now made at the presentation layer, following 6-layer architecture principles.

### **Previous Release: v6.8.0 - DRY Improvements - Platform Switch Consolidation**
🔧 **PlatformStrategy Module**: Consolidated 19 platform switch statements into a centralized `PlatformStrategy` module. Eliminated 4 duplicate functions. Total: 23 code duplications eliminated. Single source of truth for platform-specific simple values.

🔄 **Runtime Check Pattern Consistency**: Established consistent pattern for runtime capability checks in `PlatformStrategy`. Ensures platform-specific values are only returned when capabilities are actually available.

### **Previous Release: v6.7.0 - Test Fixes & Count-Based Presentation**
🆕 **Count-Based Automatic Presentation**: Added intelligent count-aware presentation strategy selection. `.automatic` presentation preference now considers item count for generic/collection content, with platform-aware thresholds. Added `.countBased(lowCount:highCount:threshold:)` enum case for explicit control.

🔧 **Touch Target Test Fixes**: Fixed touch target minimum tests to correctly validate Apple HIG compliance. Tests now correctly expect 44.0 minimum touch target when touch is enabled, with tolerance-based floating point comparison.

🧪 **Test Infrastructure Improvements**: Added frame size safety checks, fixed resource warnings in Swift Package Manager builds, removed platform mocking code from tests, and cleaned up test warnings.

### **Previous Release: v6.6.3 - ScrollView Wrapper Fixes**
🔧 **Collection View Scrolling**: Fixed missing ScrollView wrappers in all collection views. GridCollectionView, ListCollectionView, ExpandableCardCollectionView, and MasonryCollectionView now properly scroll when content exceeds view bounds, maintaining the framework's abstraction layer.

### **Previous Release: v6.6.2 - Swift 6 Compilation Fixes**
🔧 **Swift 6 Compatibility**: Fixed Swift 6 compilation errors and deprecation warnings. Includes main actor isolation fixes, iOS 17+ API updates, switch exhaustiveness fixes, and removal of unnecessary availability checks.

### **Previous Release: v6.6.1 - SPM Bundle Name Fix**
🔧 **Bundle Resource Access**: Fixed Swift Package Manager bundle name issue. Updated to use `Bundle.module` for Swift Package builds with proper fallback for Xcode framework builds. Fixed `CFBundleName` in Info.plist.

### **Previous Release: v6.6.0 - Platform Capability Detection Fixes**
🔧 **Apple HIG Compliance**: Fixed platform capability detection to align with Apple Human Interface Guidelines. `minTouchTarget` is now platform-based (44.0 for iOS/watchOS, 0.0 for others), `supportsAssistiveTouch` correctly checks platform availability, and tests use runtime platform detection for better accuracy.

### **Previous Release: v6.5.0 - Swift 6 Compilation Fixes & Test Infrastructure**
🔧 **Swift 6 Compatibility**: Fixed all compilation errors and actor isolation issues for full Swift 6 compatibility. Includes fixes for CloudKitService, test kit examples, and design system tests. Test infrastructure improved with proper async setup/teardown and actor isolation.

### **Previous Release: v6.4.2 - Platform Bottom-Bar Toolbar Placement Helper**
🔧 **Cross-Platform Toolbar Placement**: Added `platformBottomBarPlacement()` function for bottom-aligned toolbar items. Returns `.bottomBar` on iOS and `.automatic` on macOS/other platforms. Resolves Issue #125.

### **Previous Release: v6.4.1 - NotificationService Bug Fix**
🐛 **Compilation Fix**: Fixed optional Bool unwrapping in `NotificationService.checkIOSDoNotDisturbStatusAsync()` (Issue #124). Function now properly handles nil Focus status values with conservative default.

### **Previous Release: v6.4.0 - Design System Bridge & Developer Experience**
🎨 **Design System Bridge**: Framework-level abstraction for mapping external design tokens to SixLayer components with theme injection.  
🧪 **SixLayerTestKit**: Comprehensive testing utilities for framework consumers with service mocks and test helpers.

🌐 **Localization Improvements**: .xcstrings support and localization completeness checking.  
🔧 **Developer Experience**: Stable extension surface and migration tooling.

### **Previous Release: v6.1.1 - Color.named() Extensions**
🎨 **Color API improvements**: Extended `Color.named()` to support `systemBackground` and other commonly used color names (`cardBackground`, `label`, `secondaryLabel`, `tertiaryLabel`, `separator`).  
🔧 **Convenience method**: Added `Color.named(_:default:)` that returns a non-optional `Color` with a fallback, preventing compiler type-checking issues.  
🐛 **Bug fixes**: Resolved compiler type-checking timeouts when chaining multiple optionals with `Color.named()`.

### **Previous Release: v6.1.0 - Form UX Enhancements & Platform Extensions**
📝 **Form improvements**: Collapsible sections, required field indicators, character counters, validation summary, Stepper field type, and Link component for URLs.  
🔍 **OCR enhancements**: Batch OCR workflow for filling multiple fields from single scan, declarative field hints with Mirror fallback.

🔧 **Intelligent decimal correction**: Automatically corrects missing decimal points using expected ranges and calculation groups as heuristics.  
📊 **Range inference**: Infers ranges from calculation groups for fields without explicit ranges.  
⚠️ **Field adjustment tracking**: `OCRResult.adjustedFields` tracks which fields were adjusted or calculated for user verification.  
📈 **Enhanced range validation**: Expected ranges are now guidelines (not hard requirements) - out-of-range values are kept but flagged.  
📊 **Field averages**: Apps can provide typical/average values to flag unusual values even within range.  
🔄 **Bidirectional pattern matching**: Handles both "Gallons 9.022" and "9.022 Gallons" patterns.  
🧪 **Comprehensive testing**: Range validation tests cover boundaries, precedence, and edge cases.

### **Previous Release: v5.7.0 – Automatic OCR Hints & Structured Extraction Intelligence**
📄 **Configurable entity mapping**: `OCRContext` now accepts `entityName` so projects choose which `.hints` file to load.  
🤖 **Automatic hints loading**: `OCRService` loads `{entityName}.hints`, converts `ocrHints` to regex patterns, and merges them with built-in/custom hints.  
🧮 **Calculation group evaluation**: Structured extraction automatically derives missing values (e.g., price-per-gallon) using hint-defined formulas.
