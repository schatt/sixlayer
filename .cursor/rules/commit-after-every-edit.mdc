# Commit After Every Edit

## **MANDATORY**

**EVERY time you edit a file, you commit it.**

- **Immediately after** using the **write** or **search_replace** tool: run `git add <that file>` and `git commit` with a clear message. Do not call write or search_replace on another file until the current file is committed.
- One edit → one commit. Do not batch multiple file edits into a single commit.
- This applies to every edit in the session, no exceptions.

## **Workflow**

1. Edit file(s) for one logical change (write or search_replace).
2. **Before any other tool call**: stage and commit those files (`git add` then `git commit`).
3. Then proceed to the next change.

## **Rationale**

Commits are cheap. Uncommitted work is risk. One commit per edit keeps history clear and the working tree clean.
