# Commit After Every Edit

## **MANDATORY**

**EVERY time you edit a file, you commit it.**

- After saving changes to **any** file, run `git add <that file>` and `git commit` with a clear message.
- One edit → one commit. Do not batch multiple file edits into a single commit.
- Do not continue editing other files until the current file’s changes are committed.
- This applies to every edit in the session, no exceptions.

## **Workflow**

1. Edit file(s) for one logical change.
2. **Immediately** stage and commit those files.
3. Then proceed to the next change.

## **Rationale**

Commits are cheap. Uncommitted work is risk. One commit per edit keeps history clear and the working tree clean.
