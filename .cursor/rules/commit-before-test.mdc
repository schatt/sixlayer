# Commit Before Test (BLOCKING)

## **MANDATORY — BLOCKING**

- **Do not run any test command** (e.g. `xcodebuild test`, `dbs-build --target test`, `pytest`, `npm test`, or any `run_terminal_cmd` that runs tests) **until all current work is committed.**

## **REQUIRED SEQUENCE**

1. **Before** invoking a test run: run `git status`.
2. **If** there are uncommitted changes: run `git add` for the relevant path(s), then `git commit -m "<message>"`.
3. **Only then** run the test command.

## **NO EXCEPTIONS**

- Running tests with uncommitted changes violates this rule.
- "I'll commit after the test" is not allowed. Commit first, then test.
