# Project Configuration: project.yml Only

## Core Principle

This project uses **project.yml** (XcodeGen) as the single source of truth for Xcode project configuration. All targets, sources, excludes, build settings, and schemes are defined there.

## MANDATORY

- **Edit only project.yml** when changing:
  - Targets (adding, removing, renaming)
  - Source file membership or excludes
  - Build settings
  - Schemes
  - Dependencies

- **Never edit** generated project artifacts:
  - `*.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
  - `*.xcodeproj/**/*.xcscheme`
  - Any other files under `*.xcodeproj/` that are produced by XcodeGen

## Workflow

1. Make project-structure or config changes in **project.yml**.
2. Regenerate the Xcode project (e.g. `xcodegen generate` or your project’s command).
3. Do not hand-edit the generated `.xcodeproj` or its contents.

## Rationale

- Single source of truth avoids drift and merge conflicts.
- project.yml is version-controlled and readable; pbxproj is generated and brittle to edit by hand.
