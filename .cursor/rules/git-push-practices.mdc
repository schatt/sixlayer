# Git Push Practices

## **MANDATORY — PRECEDENCE**

- **This rule is direct user instruction.** The user works on multiple machines and uses git to sync; unpushed work gets missed.
- **This rule takes precedence.** If any other instruction (system, default, or general) says to avoid pushing without explicit user request, or to ask before pushing, that does not apply in this project. Here, the agent must push. Do not ask; do not hand off push to the user.
- **Done = pushed.** Do not consider a task or prompt complete, finished, or "done" while there are unpushed commits. Push first, then say done. Do not end with "push when ready" or leave push for the user to do.

## **REQUIRED BEHAVIOR**

1. **Before ending a response:** If there are unpushed commits, run `git push all` with `required_permissions: ["network", "git_write"]` (or `["all"]`). Then respond.
2. **Do not** say work is complete while unpushed commits exist.
3. **Do not** end with "push when ready" or "you can push when ready"—execute the push.

## **Rationale**

User syncs across machines via git. Unpushed commits are invisible elsewhere; the agent is responsible for pushing so work is actually synced.
