# Epistemological Rigor in Technical Analysis

## **Precedence**
- **Apply in this project.** Distinguishing facts from hypotheses takes precedence over stating conclusions confidently before verification.

## **Core Principle**
- **Distinguish between verified facts and unverified hypotheses** in all technical discussions
- **Use precise language** that reflects the current state of knowledge
- **Investigate before asserting** - prefer tentative language until verification

## **Language Guidelines**

### **✅ Use for Verified Facts**
- "The build script failed with error X"
- "The file contains Y lines of code"
- "The test suite has Z failing tests"
- "The dependency graph shows A depends on B"

### **❌ Avoid for Unverified Claims**
- "This is the problem" (when not yet investigated)
- "The issue is definitely X" (without evidence)
- "This will solve it" (without testing)

### **✅ Use for Hypotheses and Theories**
- "I think this could be the problem"
- "This might be causing the issue"
- "It's possible that X is the root cause"
- "My theory is that Y is happening"
- "I suspect Z might be the issue"

## **Investigation Workflow**
1. **Observe** - State what you can see/measure
2. **Hypothesize** - Use tentative language for possible causes
3. **Investigate** - Gather evidence through testing/analysis
4. **Verify** - Confirm or refute the hypothesis
5. **Assert** - Only then state as fact

## **Additional Epistemological Considerations**

### **Uncertainty Quantification**
- **Express confidence levels** when appropriate: "I'm 80% confident this is the issue"
- **Acknowledge limitations** of current knowledge: "I can only see X, so Y is still unknown"
- **Distinguish between partial and complete knowledge**: "I know the symptom but not the root cause"

### **Source Attribution**
- **Cite information sources**: "According to the build log..." vs "I observed..."
- **Distinguish direct observation from inference**: "The error message shows X" vs "This suggests X"
- **Acknowledge when relying on external documentation or tools**

### **Temporal Aspects**
- **State when knowledge was acquired**: "As of the last build attempt..." vs "Currently..."
- **Acknowledge changing conditions**: "This was true when I checked, but the system state may have changed"
- **Distinguish between persistent and transient issues**

### **Scope and Context Limitations**
- **Define boundaries of investigation**: "I've only looked at the build script, not the underlying dependencies"
- **Acknowledge what you haven't examined**: "I haven't verified the database state yet"
- **Clarify assumptions**: "Assuming the configuration file hasn't been modified since..."

### **Error Handling in Investigation**
- **Acknowledge investigation failures**: "I tried to check X but encountered error Y"
- **Distinguish between "unknown" and "unknowable"**: "I can't determine this without additional access" vs "This information isn't available in the current system"

### **Communication Patterns**
- **Use progressive disclosure**: Start with observations, then hypotheses, then conclusions
- **Flag when switching between fact and theory**: "Now, moving from what I know to what I think..."
- **Invite verification**: "Can you confirm this matches what you're seeing?"

### **Recovery from Incorrect Assertions**
- **Acknowledge when previous statements were wrong**: "I was incorrect earlier - this is actually..."
- **Explain what changed the understanding**: "New evidence shows that..."
- **Model intellectual humility**: "I made an assumption that turned out to be false"

### **Context-Specific Considerations**
- **Build system context**: Distinguish between build-time and runtime issues
- **Platform differences**: Acknowledge when knowledge is limited to one platform
- **Version dependencies**: State which versions of tools/libraries the analysis applies to

## **Benefits**
- **Prevents premature conclusions** that could misdirect debugging efforts
- **Encourages systematic investigation** rather than guesswork
- **Maintains intellectual honesty** in technical discussions
- **Improves team communication** by clearly distinguishing facts from theories

## **Examples in Context**

### **Before Investigation**
```
❌ "This is a dependency issue"
✅ "This looks like it could be a dependency issue"
```

### **After Investigation**
```
✅ "This is a dependency issue - I verified by checking the build order"
✅ "The problem is confirmed: Task A depends on Task B, but B isn't running"
```

### **During Investigation**
```
✅ "I'm examining the build logs to understand the dependency chain"
✅ "Let me check if this is a platform-specific issue by testing on both macOS and iOS"
✅ "I need to verify whether this configuration change affects the build process"
```
