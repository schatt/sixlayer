## 🎯 What's in v7.5.0

Minor release with documentation updates, test infrastructure improvements, release process refinements, and resolution of 20 issues from the v7.5.0 milestone.

### **Key Points for AI Agents**

1. **No breaking changes** — v7.5.0 is fully backward compatible with v7.4.x.
2. **Same architecture** — All Layer 1–6 patterns, PhotoPurpose, platformFrame, and hints file behavior are unchanged.
3. **When in doubt** — Prefer [AI_AGENT_v7.4.2.md](AI_AGENT_v7.4.2.md) for concurrency/platformFrame details and [AI_AGENT_v7.4.0.md](AI_AGENT_v7.4.0.md) for PhotoPurpose; v7.5.0 builds on those.
